When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; Nothing To Envy . &quot;
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
Although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
It read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
I was so shocked .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
Soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can &apos;t erase from my memory .
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother &apos;s face .
But nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s .
Ultimately , more than a million North Koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
Power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors .
This is the Amrok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Koreans to secretly cross .
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river .
I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
One day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
Someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explode .
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
After they finished questioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
And they let me go . It was a miracle .
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated .
These girls were so lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
These North Koreans were not so lucky .
Every year , countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
It &apos;s tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
That &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
Also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
I even went through an identity crisis .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
Suddenly , there was no country I could proudly call my own .
Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university entrance exam .
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .
The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside .
They had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escape .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ironically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border .
Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia .
The journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
One time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer .
He took everyone &apos;s I.D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
As the Chinese officer approached my family , I impulsively stood up , and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning .
He looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me .
We made it all the way to the border of Laos , but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos .
But even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
After I paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos .
This was one of the lowest points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy .
I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to get my family out , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
At that moment , I heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
In my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail .
I thanked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people . &quot;
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
Eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were reunited in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
Many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
So we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support .
I &apos;m confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .
Thank you .
Today I have just one request .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Now I &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
Remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
He &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot .
Remi knows what love is .
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
He &apos;s not greedy . He doesn &apos;t see skin color .
He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : He has never told a lie .
When he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Samuel is 16 . He &apos;s tall . He &apos;s very handsome .
He has the most impeccable memory .
He has a selective one , though .
He doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod , conversations we had when he was four , weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies , and Lady Gaga &apos;s birthday .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often bypassed and misunderstood .
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
Now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
It manifests in each individual differently , hence why Remi is so different from Sam .
And across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism , but I cannot recall a day without it .
I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life .
And after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
He screamed a lot .
He didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me whatsoever .
Remi lived and reigned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between .
And as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
Extraordinary .
Now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
But I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individuality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with normality .
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
It just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! Everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
The chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
It &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s raining a lot .
Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt .
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle , and pass these cars , then that &apos;s not very nice .
Also , asphalt can create a lot of noise .
It &apos;s a noisy material , and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands , very close to cities , then we would like a silent road .
The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt .
Porous asphalt , a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands , it has pores and water can just rain through it , so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that &apos;s easy to drive on , so no splash water anymore .
Also the noise will disappear in these pores .
Because it &apos;s very hollow , all the noise will disappear , so it &apos;s a very silent road .
It also has disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur .
What is raveling ? You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off .
First you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they -- well , I will not do that .
But they can damage your windshield , so you &apos;re not happy with that .
And finally , this raveling can also lead to more and more damage .
Sometimes you can create potholes with that .
Ha . He &apos;s ready .
Potholes , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
It &apos;s a porous asphalt , like I said , so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones .
Due to weathering , due to U.V. light , due to oxidation , this binder , this bitumen , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it shrinks , it gets micro-cracks , and it delaminates from the aggregates .
Then if you drive over the road , you take out the aggregates -- what we just saw here .
To solve this problem , we thought of self-healing materials .
If we can make this material self-healing , then probably we have a solution .
So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans , and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen .
So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it .
Then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine .
Induction can heat , especially steel ; it &apos;s very good at that .
Then what you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the bitumen , and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks , and the stones are again fixed to the surface .
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage .
So a microwave is a similar system .
So I put the specimen in , which I &apos;m now going to take out to see what happened .
So this is the specimen coming out now .
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
We tested a lot of specimens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s very interesting . We have to try that . &quot;
So they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the A58 , where we had to make a test track to test this material .
So that &apos;s what we did here . You see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . That &apos;s what we know from practice .
So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .
So we did aging on the samples , did a lot of loading on it , healed them with our induction machine , and healed them and tested them again .
Several times we can repeat that .
So actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
Well , to conclude , I can say that we made a material using steel fibers , the addition of steel fibers , using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
And now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .
So we still have the specimen here . It &apos;s quite warm .
Actually , it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works .
But I will do a trial .
Let &apos;s see . Yeah , it worked .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer .
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : Why does she stay ?
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just graduated from Harvard College .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first little green American Express card , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate , many , many times .
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College , an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson , Leo Burnett and The Washington Post .
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
My dog is a black lab , and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan .
So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
Not exactly .
Over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States .
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
I met Conor on a cold , rainy January night .
He sat next to me on the New York City subway , and he started chatting me up .
He told me two things .
One was that he , too , had just graduated from an Ivy League school , and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank .
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
He had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair , and he seemed so sweet .
One of the smartest things Conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship .
He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me .
We started dating , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job .
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
Conor believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
Now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , &quot; You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you &quot; — — &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot;
Instead , Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me , because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so I agreed , and I quit my job , and Conor and I left Manhattan together .
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap .
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
And here &apos;s where those guns come in .
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know , that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns .
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
He kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
He needed them to feel protected .
But those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
Five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and I put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and I married him .
Despite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much .
And he was very , very sorry .
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
It was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
The first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
And then a few days later , driving home from our honeymoon , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face .
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million .
So actually , I was in very good company .
Back to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
Instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons .
The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
To me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser .
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the abuser has nothing left to lose .
Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
I was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial .
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
So I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
The question , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
is code for some people for , &quot; It &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us .
But since publishing &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives -- joyous , happy lives -- as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
I remarried a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids .
I have that black lab , and I have that minivan .
What I will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves .
Abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
It &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you .
Talk about what you heard here .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
Recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures .
Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out .
Together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be .
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds .
When you see a vulture like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are disgusting , ugly , greedy creatures that are just after your flesh , associated with politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our sympathy . They really do .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832 on the Beagle , he saw the turkey vulture , and he said , &quot; These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity . &quot;
You could not get a worse insult , and that from Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed his mind when he came back , and I &apos;ll tell you why .
They &apos;ve also be associated with Disney — — personified as goofy , dumb , stupid characters .
More recently , if you &apos;ve been following the Kenyan press — — these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with . But I want to challenge that .
I want to challenge that . Do you know why ?
Because MPs do not keep the environment clean .
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
They are hardly monogamous .
They are far from being extinct .
And , my favorite is , vultures are better looking .
So there &apos;s two types of vultures in this planet .
There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas , like the condors and the caracaras , and then the Old World vultures , where we have 16 species . From these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
So why are vultures important ? First of all , they provide vital ecological services . They clean up .
They &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
They clean up carcasses right to the bone .
They help to kill all the bacteria . They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals .
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures , carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose , and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases .
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture .
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood , and together with the cobra , symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt .
In Hindu mythology , Jatayu was the vulture god , and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the 10-headed demon Ravana .
In Tibetan culture , they are performing very important sky burials . In places like Tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to cremate them , so these vultures provide a natural disposal system .
So what is the problem with vultures ?
We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .
The reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s human-wildlife conflicts . The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the vultures are falling victim to this .
In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac .
This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India , and they have taken a stand .
Because there are no vultures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have feral dogs , you have a huge time bomb of rabies . The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa : 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana .
I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turbines do this to birds . They slice them in half .
They are bird-blending machines .
In West Africa , there &apos;s a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market .
So what &apos;s being done ? Well , we &apos;re conducting research on these birds . We &apos;re putting transmitters on them .
We &apos;re trying to determine their basic ecology , and see where they go .
We can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it &apos;s not going to help you .
We need to work with governments in regional levels .
We &apos;re working with local communities .
We &apos;re talking to them about appreciating vultures , about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
How can you help ? You can become active , make noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures . Volunteer your time to spread the word . Spread the word .
When you walk out of this room , you will be informed about vultures , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighbors about vultures .
They are very graceful . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies .
Kenya , this world , will be much poorer without these wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
&quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father shouted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Were we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot;
What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Thank you .
