And so , scientists and engineers , when 
Thank you .
Hi . My name is Cameron Russell , 
Actually , for 10 years .
And I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable 
So luckily I brought an outfit change .
This is the first outfit change on the 
If some of the women were really horrified 
I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite 
Not everybody gets to do that .
These heels are very uncomfortable , so good 
The worst part is putting this sweater over 
All right .
So why did I do that ?
That was awkward .
Well , hopefully not as awkward as that 
Image is powerful , but also image is 
I just totally transformed what you thought of 
And in this picture , I had actually 
I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer 
And of course , barring surgery , or 
So today , for me , being fearless 
And I am on this stage because I 
I am on this stage because I am 
And I &apos;m going to answer the questions 
So the first question is , how do 
And I always just say , &quot; Oh 
The real way that I became a model 
Well , for the past few centuries we 
And this is a legacy that was built 
And I know there are people in the 
And first , I commend you on your 
But unfortunately I have to inform you that 
The next question people always ask me is 
And the first answer is , &quot; I 
But the second answer , and what I 
You know ? You can be anything .
You could be the President of the United 
If , after this amazing list , they 
Because I &apos;m not in charge of anything 
Saying that you want to be a model 
It &apos;s out of your control , and 
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years 
So if the photographer is right there and 
It will look something like this .
Hopefully less awkward than that one in the 
That was , I don &apos;t know what 
Unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , 
The next question people always ask me is 
And yeah , they pretty much retouch all 
This picture is the very first picture that 
I know we &apos;re getting personal , but 
This is what I looked like with my 
Here &apos;s me on the same day as 
My friend got to come with me .
Here &apos;s me at a slumber party a 
Here &apos;s me on the soccer team and 
And here &apos;s me today .
And I hope what you &apos;re seeing is 
They are constructions , and they are constructions 
Okay , so the next question people always 
I do have too many 8-inch heels which 
I grew up in Cambridge , and one 
When I was a teenager , I was 
And I got these free things because of 
I live in New York , and last 
And there are only 177,000 young black and 
but &quot; How many times will I get 
When I was researching this talk , I 
So the last question people ask me is 
And I think the answer that they &apos;re 
And when we &apos;re backstage , we give 
We say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing 
And those things are true , but they 
And I &apos;m insecure because I have to 
And if you ever are wondering , &quot; 
you just need to meet a group of 
So when I was writing this talk , 
But mostly it was difficult to unpack a 
But I &apos;m also happy and honored to 
If there &apos;s a takeaway to this talk 
Thank you .
There are a lot of ways the people 
We don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , 
So over the past few years , I 
And these projects came from questions I had 
How can we lend and borrow more things 
How can we share more of our memories 
And how can we share more of our 
Now , I live in New Orleans , 
My soul is always soothed by the giant 
I feel like every time someone sneezes , 
The city has some of the most beautiful 
I live near this house , and I 
In 2009 , I lost someone I loved 
Her name was Joan , and she was 
And I thought about death a lot , 
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in 
I feel like it &apos;s easy to get 
So with help from old and new friends 
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from 
And I &apos;d like to share a few 
&quot; Before I die , I want to 
&quot; Before I die , I want to 
&quot; Before I die , I want to 
&quot; Before I die , I want to 
&quot; Before I die , I want to 
&quot; Before I die , I want to 
&quot; Before I die , I want to 
&quot; Before I die , I want to 
So this neglected space became a constructive one 
It &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone 
It &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new 
It &apos;s about making space for reflection and 
I made this last year , and started 
Together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our 
Two of the most valuable things we have 
In our age of increasing distractions , it 
Death is something that we &apos;re often discouraged 
Thinking about death clarifies your life .
Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters 
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , well , I do applied math 
No one knows what the hell we do 
So I am going to give you some 
So , dancing is one of the most 
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers 
Now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of 
Now , sadly , neurological disorders such as 
So great progress and treatment has been made 
However , there are 6.3 million people worldwide 
We need to be able to measure progression 
But frustratingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and 
You have to go to the clinic to 
But what if patients could do this test 
Now , that would actually save on a 
No expensive staff time required .
Takes about $ 300 , by the way 
So what I want to propose to you 
So here we have a video of the 
Now , this is healthy and this is 
And like ballet , it takes an extraordinary 
I mean , just think how long it 
From the sound , we can actually track 
So on the bottom trace , you can 
We see all the same symptoms .
We see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity 
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy 
So these vocal effects can actually be quite 
So these voice-based tests , how do they 
The neurologist &apos;s test is non-invasive . They 
You don &apos;t have to design a whole 
And they &apos;re both accurate . Okay , 
That means they can be self-administered .
They &apos;re high-speed , take about 30 seconds 
They &apos;re ultra-low cost , and we all 
When something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes 
So here are some amazing goals that I 
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
No need to go to the clinic for 
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective 
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical 
We have the opportunity to start to search 
So , taking the first steps towards this 
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe , we &apos;re aiming 
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters 
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call 
Thank you .
So Max , by taking all these samples 
What are you going to get out of 
Yeah . Yeah . So what will happen 
You see , some people may not do 
But we &apos;ll get a very large sample 
So you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now 
It &apos;s much better than that .
Actually , my student Thanasis , I have 
Ninety-nine . Well , that &apos;s an improvement 
So what that means is that people will 
Absolutely .
Thanks so much . Max Little , everybody 
Thanks , Tom .
I live in South Central .
This is South Central : liquor stores , 
So the city planners , they get together 
This is South Los Angeles .
Liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots 
Just like 26.5 million other Americans , I 
Funny thing is , the drive-thrus are killing 
People are dying from curable diseases in South 
For instance , the obesity rate in my 
I got tired of seeing this happening .
And I was wondering , how would you 
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used 
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks 
And I figured , this has to stop 
So I figured that the problem is the 
Food is the problem and food is the 
Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes 
So what I did , I planted a 
It was on a strip of land that 
It &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
Thing is , it &apos;s owned by the 
But you have to maintain it .
So I &apos;m like , &quot; Cool . 
And this is how I decided to maintain 
So me and my group , L.A. Green 
What we do , we &apos;re a pay-it-forward 
And the garden , it was beautiful .
And then somebody complained .
The city came down on me , and 
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on 
A warrant for planting food on a piece 
And I was like , &quot; Cool . 
Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up 
So L.A. Times got ahold of it . 
We had a victory on our hands .
My councilman even called in and said how 
I mean , come on , why wouldn 
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots 
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots 
That &apos;s 20 Central Parks .
That &apos;s enough space to plant 725 million 
Why in the hell would they not okay 
Growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 
When one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans 
It &apos;s my gospel , when I &apos;m 
Growing your own food is like printing your 
See , I have a legacy in South 
I grew up there . I raised my 
And I refuse to be a part of 
See , I &apos;m an artist .
Gardening is my graffiti . I grow my 
Just like a graffiti artist , where they 
I use the garden , the soil , 
You &apos;d be surprised what the soil could 
You just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a 
So what happened ?
I have witnessed my garden become a tool 
To change the community , you have to 
We are the soil .
You &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected 
Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act 
Plus you get strawberries .
I remember this time , there was this 
So I &apos;m like , man , it 
This is on the street for a reason 
It made me feel ashamed to see people 
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Hell no 
That &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street 
That &apos;s the whole idea .
I want them to take it , but 
There &apos;s another time when I put a 
These are the guys , they helped me 
It was cool , and they just shared 
So Green Grounds has gone on to plant 
We &apos;ve had , like , 50 people 
If kids grow kale , kids eat kale 
If they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes 
But when none of this is presented to 
I see young people and they want to 
So with gardening , I see an opportunity 
And when we do this , who knows 
We might produce the next George Washington Carver 
but if we don &apos;t change the composition 
Now this is one of my plans . 
I want to plant a whole block of 
I want to take shipping containers and turn 
Now don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about no free shit 
The funny thing about sustainability , you have 
What I &apos;m talking about is putting people 
So what I want to do here , 
So I want us all to become ecolutionary 
We gotta flip the script on what a 
If you ain &apos;t a gardener , you 
Get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
And let that be your weapon of choice 
So basically , if you want to meet 
If you want to meet with me , 
Peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live 
Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the 
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the 
So predators like lions follow them , and 
They kill our livestock .
This is one of the cows which was 
My community , the Maasai , we believe 
So I grew up hating lions so much 
The morans are the warriors who protect our 
So they kill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which 
And I think this is why the Nairobi 
So a boy , from six to nine 
So I had to find a way of 
And the first idea I got was to 
But I came to realize that that didn 
So I didn &apos;t give up . I 
And a second idea I got was to 
I was trying to trick the lions &#91; 
But lions are very clever .
They will come the first day and they 
So he jumps in and kills the animals 
So one night , I was walking around 
And I discovered that lions are afraid of 
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I 
So I got an old car battery , 
And I got a switch where I can 
And that &apos;s a small torch from a 
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar panel 
And the indicator box makes the lights flash 
As you can see , the bulbs face 
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions 
The lights flash and trick the lions into 
Thanks .
So I set it up in my home 
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea 
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being 
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
So I put the lights . You can 
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven 
And my idea is also being used now 
Because of this invention , I was lucky 
My new school now is coming in and 
I even took my friends back to my 
So one year ago , I was just 
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane 
So my big dream is to become an 
I used to hate lions , but now 
Ashê olên . It means in my language 
You have no idea how exciting it is 
So you got this scholarship . Yep .
You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list 
My next invention is , I want to 
But I know electric fences are already invented 
You already tried it once , right , 
In the trenches . Richard Turere , you 
We &apos;re going to cheer you on every 
Thank you so much . Thank you .
Everything I do , and everything I do 
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young 
I worked for an Italian NGO , and 
And I was distraught .
I thought , age 21 , that we 
Instead , everything we touched we killed .
Our first project , the one that has 
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in 
And of course the local people had absolutely 
And we were amazed that the local people 
But instead of asking them how come they 
&quot; Just in the nick of time to 
And of course , everything in Africa grew 
We had these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy 
And we could not believe , and we 
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and 
And we said to the Zambians , &quot; 
And the Zambians said , &quot; Yes , 
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell us ? 
I thought it was only us Italians blundering 
Because , you see , at least we 
You should see the rubbish — -- You 
You want to read the book , read 
The book was published in 2009 .
We Western donor countries have given the African 
I &apos;m not going to tell you the 
Just go and read her book .
Read it from an African woman , the 
We Western people are imperialist , colonialist missionaries 
The two words come from the Latin root 
But they mean two different things .
Paternalistic , I treat anybody from a different 
Patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture 
That &apos;s why the white people in Africa 
I was given a slap in the face 
This should be the first principle of aid 
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the gentleman who opened this 
I decided when I was 27 years old 
So what you do -- you shut up 
You never arrive in a community with any 
We don &apos;t work from offices .
We meet at the cafe . We meet 
We have zero infrastructure .
And what we do , we become friends 
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do 
The passion that the person has for her 
The passion that that man has for his 
And then we help them to go and 
The person with the idea may not have 
So years and years ago , I had 
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community meetings .
