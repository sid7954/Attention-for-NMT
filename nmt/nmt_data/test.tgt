When I was little , I thought my 
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of 
Although I often wondered about the outside world 
When I was seven years old , I 
My family was not poor , and myself 
But one day , in 1995 , my 
It read , &quot; When you read this 
We are lying on the floor together , 
I was so shocked .
This was the first time I heard that 
Soon after , when I was walking past 
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground 
But nobody helped them , because they were 
A huge famine hit North Korea in the 
Ultimately , more than a million North Koreans 
Power outages also became more and more frequent 
I always wondered why they had lights but 
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea 
This is the Amrok River , which serves 
As you can see , the river can 
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down 
I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about 
But I only thought that I would be 
I could have never imagined that it would 
In China , it was hard living as 
I had no idea what life was going 
So I was living in constant fear that 
One day , my worst nightmare came true 
Someone had accused me of being North Korean 
I was so scared , I thought my 
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be 
I thought my life was over , but 
After they finished questioning me , one official 
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
And they let me go . It was 
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in 
These girls were so lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were 
These North Koreans were not so lucky .
Every year , countless North Koreans are caught 
Even though I was really fortunate to get 
It &apos;s tragic that North Koreans have to 
Even after learning a new language and getting 
That &apos;s why , after 10 years of 
Settling down in South Korea was a lot 
English was so important in South Korea , 
Also , I realized there was a wide 
We are all Korean , but inside , 
I even went through an identity crisis .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
Where am I from ? Who am I 
Suddenly , there was no country I could 
Even though adjusting to life in South Korea 
I started studying for the university entrance exam 
Just as I was starting to get used 
The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that 
They had to get out quickly , so 
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on 
It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border 
Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , 
The journey by bus took one week , 
One time , our bus was stopped and 
He took everyone &apos;s I.D. cards , and 
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , 
As the Chinese officer approached my family , 
He looked at me suspiciously , but luckily 
We made it all the way to the 
But even after we got past the border 
After I paid the fine and bribe , 
This was one of the lowest points in 
I did everything to get my family to 
I went back and forth between the immigration 
I lost all hope .
At that moment , I heard one man 
I was so surprised that a total stranger 
In my broken English , and with a 
I thanked him with all my heart , 
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; 
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people 
I realized that this was a symbolic moment 
The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me 
Eventually , after our long journey , my 
Many North Koreans are separated from their families 
So we can benefit from the international community 
We can also act as a bridge between 
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so 
I &apos;m confident that you will see more 
Thank you .
Today I have just one request .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal 
Now I &apos;d like to introduce you to 
Remi is 22 , tall and very handsome 
He &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy 
Remi knows what love is .
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it 
He &apos;s not greedy . He doesn &apos;t 
He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , 
When he sings songs from our childhood , 
Samuel is 16 . He &apos;s tall . 
He has the most impeccable memory .
He has a selective one , though .
He doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my 
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because their minds don 
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my 
Now , for you who may be less 
It manifests in each individual differently , hence 
And across the world , every 20 minutes 
And I cannot remember the first moment I 
I was just three years old when my 
And after a few months went by , 
He screamed a lot .
He didn &apos;t want to play like the 
Remi lived and reigned in his own world 
And as he grew older , he grew 
Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and 
Extraordinary .
Now , I cannot deny that there have 
But I cast my mind back to the 
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us 
It just means that there &apos;s a different 
And if I could communicate just one thing 
You can be extraordinary .
Because autistic or not , the differences that 
The chance for greatness , for progress and 
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m 
Thank you .
You probably all agree with me that this 
It &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt 
Then you can have a lot of splash 
And especially if you then ride with your 
Also , asphalt can create a lot of 
It &apos;s a noisy material , and if 
The solution for that is to make roads 
Porous asphalt , a material that we use 
Also the noise will disappear in these pores 
Because it &apos;s very hollow , all the 
It also has disadvantages , of course , 
What is raveling ? You see that in 
First you get one stone , then several 
But they can damage your windshield , so 
And finally , this raveling can also lead 
Sometimes you can create potholes with that .
Ha . He &apos;s ready .
Potholes , of course , that can become 
Here you see actually how the damage appears 
It &apos;s a porous asphalt , like I 
Due to weathering , due to U.V. light 
Then if you drive over the road , 
To solve this problem , we thought of 
If we can make this material self-healing , 
So what we can do is use steel 
So then you have asphalt with very small 
Then you need a machine , like you 
Induction can heat , especially steel ; it 
Then what you do is you heat up 
Today I use a microwave because I cannot 
So a microwave is a similar system .
So I put the specimen in , which 
So this is the specimen coming out now 
So I said we have such an industrial 
We tested a lot of specimens there , 
So they donated to us a piece of 
So that &apos;s what we did here . 
So we took a lot of samples from 
So we did aging on the samples , 
Several times we can repeat that .
So actually , the conclusion from this research 
Well , to conclude , I can say 
And now you &apos;re of course curious if 
So we still have the specimen here . 
Actually , it still has to cool down 
But I will do a trial .
Let &apos;s see . Yeah , it worked 
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a 
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence 
Why would anyone stay with a man who 
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social 
I &apos;m just one woman with a story 
I was 22 . I had just graduated 
I had moved to New York City for 
I had my first apartment , my first 
My secret was that I had this gun 
The man who I loved more than anybody 
I &apos;m here to tell you the story 
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic 
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard 
I &apos;ve spent most of my career working 
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years 
My dog is a black lab , and 
So my first message for you is that 
It &apos;s everywhere .
And my second message is that everyone thinks 
Not exactly .
Over 85 percent of abusers are men , 
I would have told you myself that I 
I was 22 , and in the United 
I was also a very typical victim because 
I met Conor on a cold , rainy 
He sat next to me on the New 
He told me two things .
One was that he , too , had 
But what made the biggest impression on me 
He had these big cheeks , these big 
One of the smartest things Conor did , 
He did this especially at the beginning by 
We started dating , and he loved everything 
He wanted to know everything about my family 
Conor believed in me , as a writer 
And he also created a magical atmosphere of 
Which is why that Ivy League degree and 
If you had told me that this smart 
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage 
I also didn &apos;t know that the second 
Now , Conor did not come home one 
Instead , Conor came home one Friday evening 
Now , the last thing I wanted to 
I had no idea I was falling into 
The next step in the domestic violence pattern 
And here &apos;s where those guns come in 
As soon as we moved to New England 
He kept one in the glove compartment of 
He kept one under the pillows on our 
And he said that he needed those guns 
He needed them to feel protected .
But those guns were really a message for 
Conor first physically attacked me five days before 
It was 7 a.m. I still had on 
I was working on my computer trying to 
Five days later , the ten bruises on 
Despite what had happened , I was sure 
And he was very , very sorry .
He had just been really stressed out by 
It was an isolated incident , and he 
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
The first time , I was driving to 
And then a few days later , driving 
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice 
I was mistaken in thinking that I was 
One in three American women experiences domestic violence 
So actually , I was in very good 
Back to my question : Why did I 
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me 
Even though he held those loaded guns to 
Instead , I was a very strong woman 
The other question everybody asks is , why 
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I 
To me , this is the saddest and 
Because the final step in the domestic violence 
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen 
Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after 
And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t 
I was able to leave , because of 
I realized that the man who I loved 
So I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my 
We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines 
The question , &quot; Why does she stay 
is code for some people for , &quot; 
But since publishing &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; 
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually 
I remarried a kind and gentle man , 
I have that black lab , and I 
What I will never have again , ever 
Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , 
I promise you there are several people listening 
Abuse could be affecting your daughter , your 
I was able to end my own crazy 
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
It &apos;s my way of helping other victims 
Talk about what you heard here .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence 
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand 
Show abuse the light of day by talking 
Recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with 
Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously 
Together we can make our beds , our 
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about 
There are 10,000 species of birds in the 
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of 
When you see a vulture like this , 
I want to change that perception . I 
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why do they have 
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 
You could not get a worse insult , 
You know , he changed his mind when 
They &apos;ve also be associated with Disney — 
More recently , if you &apos;ve been following 
I want to challenge that . Do you 
Because MPs do not keep the environment clean 
MPs do not help to prevent the spread 
They are hardly monogamous .
They are far from being extinct .
And , my favorite is , vultures are 
So there &apos;s two types of vultures in 
There are the New World vultures that are 
So why are vultures important ? First of 
They &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
They clean up carcasses right to the bone 
They help to kill all the bacteria . 
Recent studies have shown that in areas where 
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture 
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and 
In Hindu mythology , Jatayu was the vulture 
In Tibetan culture , they are performing very 
So what is the problem with vultures ?
We have eight species of vultures that occur 
The reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned 
In South Asia , in countries like India 
This drug has now been banned for veterinary 
Because there are no vultures , there &apos;s 
Kenya is going to have one of the 
I am not against wind energy , but 
They are bird-blending machines .
In West Africa , there &apos;s a horrific 
So what &apos;s being done ? Well , 
We &apos;re trying to determine their basic ecology 
We can see that they travel different countries 
We need to work with governments in regional 
We &apos;re working with local communities .
We &apos;re talking to them about appreciating vultures 
How can you help ? You can become 
When you walk out of this room , 
They are very graceful . Charles Darwin said 
Kenya , this world , will be much 
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 , I remember waking 
My father was listening to BBC News on 
There was a big smile on his face 
&quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; my 
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , 
&quot; You can go to a real school 
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the 
So for the next five years , I 
It was the only way we both could 
Each day , we took a different route 
We would cover our books in grocery bags 
The school was in a house , more 
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot 
We all knew we were risking our lives 
From time to time , the school would 
We always wondered what they knew about us 
Were we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school 
I was very lucky to grow up in 
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his 
A total maverick from a remote province of 
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She retired two years ago , only to 
And my father -- that &apos;s him -- 
There was no question that his children would 
To him , there was greater risk in 
During Taliban years , I remember there were 
I would want to quit , but my 
Your money can be stolen . You can 
But the one thing that will always remain 
So do you still not want to continue 
Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has 
Fewer than six percent of women my age 
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate 
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather 
He not only brags about my college degree 
My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams 
That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador 
That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the 
The exciting thing is that I see students 
And I see their parents and their fathers 
Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real 
Less than a month ago , he and 
As he arrived home , the phone rang 
&quot; Kill me now , if you wish 
What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan 
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers 
In fact , they &apos;re often the initial 
Under the Taliban , girls who went to 
But today , more than three million girls 
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America 
I find that Americans see the fragility in 
I fear that these changes will not last 
But when I am back in Afghanistan , 
To me , Afghanistan is a country of 
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Thank you .
